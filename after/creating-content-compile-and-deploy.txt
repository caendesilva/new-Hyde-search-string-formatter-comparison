Compile and Deploy your site

Running the build command

Compile the entire site to static HTML
Now that you have some amazing content, you'll want to compile your site into static HTML.

This is as easy as executing the build command:
php hyde build

Other ways to compile the site

You can also compile a single file:
php hyde rebuild

And, you can even start a development server to compile your site on the fly:
php hyde serve

Key Concept: Autodiscovery
When building the site, Hyde will your source directories for files and compile them into static HTML using the appropriate layout depending on what kind of page it is. You don't have to worry about routing as Hyde takes care of that, including creating navigation menus!

Deploying your site

One of the things that make static sites so enjoyable to work with is how easy it is to deploy them to the web.
This list is not exhaustive, but gives you a general idea of the most common ways to deploy your site.

General deployment

In essence, all you need to do is copy the contents of the _site directory to a web server and you're done.

Once the site is compiled there is nothing to configure or worry about.

FTP and File Managers

If you have a conventional web host, you can use FTP/SFTP/FTPS to upload your site to the web server.
Some web hosting services also have web based file managers.

To deploy your site using any of these methods, all you need to do is upload the entire contents
of your site directory to the web server, usually in the publichtml, htdocs, or www directory.

GitHub Pages - Manually

GitHub Pages is a free service that allows you to host your static site on the web.

In general, push the entire contents of your _site directory to the gh-pages branch of your repository,
or the docs/ directory on your main branch, depending on how you set it up.

Please see the GitHub Pages documentation for more information.

GitHub Pages - CI/CD

Hyde works amazing with GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions and the entire build and deploy process can be automated.

- We have a great blog post on how to do this, Automate HydePHP sites using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.

- You can also copy our sample GitHub Actions Workflow.yml file.

By the way, HydePHP.com is hosted on GitHub Pages, and the site is compiled in a GitHub Action workflow that compiles and
deploys the site automatically when the source is updated using this GitHub workflow.
